2-Dimensional Galaxy/Halo Image Calculators
===========================================

This module provides a collection of calculators for creating '2-dimensional' (2D)
images from a particle system (e.g., a galaxy or halo).

These functions generate projected images, either by direct binning onto a grid
or by using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) rendering techniques.
